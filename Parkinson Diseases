Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic movement disorder mainly characterized by：
A progressive degeneration of mDA neurons in the ‘substantia nigra pars compacta’ (SNpc)
An aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) into intraneuronal structures (called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites)
An dysregulated immune activation in the SNpc.
